 # File Description
 1. Bigmart Sales Data Analysis - using ML(jupyter Notebook)
 2. README file

# Explaination
In this file, I took Bigmart sales data. there are multiple independent variables in the dataset and one dependent variable. Here i use linear regression algorithm beacuse the type of dependent variable is continous.
Create 5 different models and check which model gives better accuracy.
