# Bigmart-Sales-Data-Analysis---Using-ML
 Analysis Bigmart Data using Machine Learning Algorithm
 
 # File Description
 1. Bigmart Sales Data Analysis - using ML(jupyter Notebook)
 2. README file

# Explaination
In this file, I took Bigmart sales data. there are multiple independent variables in the dataset and one dependent variable. Here i use linear regression algorithm beacuse the type of dependent variable is continous.
Create 5 different models and check which model gives better accuracy.
  
  # Stpes
  1. Import Dataset
  2. Data Preprocessing
     1. Find and Fill the null values
     2. Convert object into int type using LabelEncoder
  4. Create Model
     1. First Model - Basic Model
        Accuracy of this model is - 0.4915164751964344
        
     2. Second Model - Using StandardScaler
         Accuracy of this model is - 0.5115059708516376
         
     3. Third Model - Using MinMaxScaler
         Accuracy of this model is - 0.500281620576159
         
     4. Fourth Model - Remove the Outlier's
          Accuracy of this model is - 0.518376290486479
          
     6. Fifth Model - Find the correlation between the columns
  5. Find the accuracy
